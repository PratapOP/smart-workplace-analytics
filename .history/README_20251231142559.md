# 🏢 Smart Workplace Analytics Platform

An **AI-powered, privacy-first workplace intelligence platform** designed to help organizations understand employee wellbeing, engagement, and productivity **without compromising trust**.

This system combines **role-based dashboards**, **explainable machine learning**, and **explicit consent enforcement** to deliver ethical people analytics.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access** (HR / Manager / Employee)
- 🧠 **Explainable AI** for burnout & risk insights
- 📊 **Unified Dashboard** with charts, trends & alerts
- 🛡 **Privacy & Consent Enforcement** (hard-gated)
- 📄 **AI-Powered Report Summaries**
- 🌐 **Single-Domain Deployment Ready** (Flask serves frontend + backend)

---

## 🧩 What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional workplace analytics tools often:
- Expose sensitive employee data
- Use opaque “black-box” AI
- Ignore consent and ethical boundaries

**Smart Workplace Analytics** is built differently:
- Only **aggregated insights** are shown
- AI outputs are **explainable and calibrated**
- Analytics are **blocked until explicit consent is given**

This makes the system suitable for **modern, ethical organizations**.

Flask App (Single Deployment)
├── Frontend (HTML / CSS / JS)
├── Auth API (Session-based)
├── ML APIs (Decision Tree + Calibration)
└── Report & Alert APIs

- Frontend and backend run on the **same domain**
- No CORS issues
- ML model is loaded once and reused

## 👥 User Roles & Views

| Role       | Access Scope |
|------------|-------------|
| Employee   | Personal insights, AI suggestions |
| Manager    | Team-level trends & alerts |
| HR         | Organization-level analytics & reports |

> All roles share the **same dashboard**, but sections are rendered dynamically based on role.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics by Design

- ✔ Explicit consent required before analytics load
- ✔ Consent stored and enforced at runtime
- ✔ No individual wellbeing data exposed to HR
- ✔ AI outputs are advisory, not judgmental
- ✔ Probability calibration prevents overconfidence

This project aligns with **Responsible AI** and **GDPR-inspired principles**.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

- **Model:** DecisionTreeClassifier (Explainable)
- **Calibration:** Sigmoid calibration for probability reliability
- **Features Used:**
  - Stress
  - Sleep
  - Work hours
  - Engagement
  - Productivity

ML is used strictly for **decision support**, not automation.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train ML model:

bash
Copy code
cd ml
python train_model.py
cd ..
Run server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Backend runs at:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
2️⃣ Access the App
Open in browser:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
Login → Consent → Dashboard

🚀 Deployment
This project is designed for single-service deployment.

Recommended Platform
Render (Python + ML friendly)

Flask serves:

Frontend pages

Static assets

APIs

ML inference

No separate frontend hosting required.

🧪 Example API Endpoints
Login
bash
Copy code
POST /api/auth/login
Predict Risk
bash
Copy code
POST /api/predict-risk
Generate AI Report Summary
bash
Copy code
POST /api/report-summary
📌 Why This Project Stands Out
Not a “toy ML project”

Not just a dashboard

Demonstrates:

System design

Ethical AI thinking

Full-stack integration

Real-world UX constraints

This is suitable for:

Portfolio

Final-year project

MVP demonstration

Interview deep-dives

🔮 Future Enhancements
JWT-based authentication

Database-backed users

Persistent consent storage

Advanced alert rules

PDF / Excel report exports

Multi-organization support
